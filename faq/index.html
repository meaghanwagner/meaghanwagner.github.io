        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>Hi. I’m The Optimist. Over the last decade — yes I am old enough that it’s been a decade — I’ve helped bring organization, strategy and joy to leaders and teams throughout NYC.</p>
        <p>I specialize in helping amazing people and frustrated teams make time to focus their talents where they are most sorely needed — on themselves.</p>

        <h2>What’s with this ‘Optimist’ pun?</h2>
        <p>Optimizing, a word which originally meant to make the best or most of, is now associated with profit-obsessed Silicon Valley bros. It’s been re-defined by rich, high-profile men who define efficiency as working <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/elon-musk-shares-personal-diet-and-exercise-routine-joe-rogan-podcast.html">120 hours per week</a> or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-shares-habits-for-focus-and-work-life-balance.html">eating only one meal a day</a> so as not to be disturbed by the plebian act of eating more than is absolutely necessary.</p>
        <p>And frankly, that sucks. Making the best of life, truly optimizing it, includes so much more than maximizing labor for money, goods and/or services. True optimizing means reducing the things you do because you should to make space for the things you want and the person you want to be. It means empowering myself -- and you -- with the confidence that comes with being an optimist, that is, one who optimizes.</p>

        <h2>What can you do for <em>me?</em></h2>
        <p>Do you already do a ton of work, but always feel like you “should” be doing more? Or spend so much time doing for others that you struggle to get things done for yourself?</p>
